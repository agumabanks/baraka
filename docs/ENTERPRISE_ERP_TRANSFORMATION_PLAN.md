# Enterprise ERP Transformation Plan
## Baraka Courier Management System → Full Enterprise ERP

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-09-30  
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a **10-phase transformation** of the Baraka shipping/courier platform from a basic dashboard system into a comprehensive enterprise-grade ERP solution. The plan uses an **orchestrator approach**, completing each phase sequentially before moving to the next.

**Core Business Model:** Shipping & Courier Operations
**Key Terminology Change:** Merchants → Branch Managers (reflecting distributed hub/branch network)

---

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ **Strengths**
- Modern Laravel 10+ stack with Blade templating
- Config-driven navigation system ([`config/admin_nav.php`](config/admin_nav.php:1))
- Robust API v1 architecture with client/shipment management
- Permission-based RBAC with `hasPermission()` helper
- Bootstrap 5 + Tailwind hybrid styling
- Recently implemented: Dark mode, skeleton loaders, badges, quick actions

### ⚠️ **Critical Issues Identified**
1. **Language dropdown broken** - Bootstrap 4/5 class conflicts (`data-toggle` vs `data-bs-toggle`)
2. **Header layout issues** - Misaligned elements in [`navber.blade.php`](resources/views/backend/partials/navber.blade.php:1)
3. **Non-functional action buttons** - Throughout admin panels (need audit)
4. **Terminology inconsistency** - "Merchant" used instead of "Branch Manager"
5. **Incomplete API integration** - New client/shipment APIs not fully exposed in admin UI
6. **Dashboard typo** - Controller named `DashbordController` instead of `DashboardController`

- **Orchestrator mode**: Coordinating multi-phase execution

### **Quality Gates**
Each phase must pass:
1. ✅ Code review (no critical issues)
2. ✅ Unit tests (>80% coverage for new code)
3. ✅ Feature tests (all scenarios pass)
4. ✅ Manual QA (acceptance criteria met)
5. ✅ Performance check (meets targets)
